/*
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

-> Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
-> Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
-> Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
-> Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
-> Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
